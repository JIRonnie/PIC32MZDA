# OCMP compare mode

This example application shows how to use the OCMP peripheral to generate an active low, active high, and toggle output on compare match.

## Description

In this application, three OCMP modules are used to generate waveforms.

**Active Low Output**: By default output is set as high and it is set as low on the compare match

**Active High Output**: By default output is set as low and it is set as high on the compare match

**Toggled Output**: Compare match toggles the output

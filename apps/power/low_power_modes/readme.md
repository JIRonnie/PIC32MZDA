# Low Power Modes

This example application demonstrates how to use different low power modes of the device.

## Description

This example application demonstrates how to use different low power modes of the device. It allows user to put the device in Idle, Sleep and Deep Sleep modes. Further, device can be woken up from these low power modes upon switch press.

## Downloading and building the application

### Setting up [PIC32MX274 XLP Starter Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/DM320105)

- To run the demo, the following additional hardware are required:
  - [USB UART click board](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click)

- Connect micro USB cable to the 'Debug USB' connector(J9) on the board to the computer
- Install an [USB UART click board](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) on to the mikroBUS socket J5
- Connect mini USB cable between PC and the [USB UART click board](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click)

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the "USB to UART" COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application project using its IDE
4. See the following message in the console:
